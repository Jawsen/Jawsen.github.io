## Conclusion

The data shows that drug-related crime was most widespread in 2009, especially during the spring and summer months. Since 2014, the number of incidents has steadily declined, with only a few cases observed in 2018–2019. This indicates a clear downward trend over time.

Geographically, most incidents occur in specific areas such as Tenderloin, Mission, Southern, and Bayview. This suggests that, although the overall crime level has decreased, it remains concentrated in certain neighborhoods.
