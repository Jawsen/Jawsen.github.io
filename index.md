### So, When Are Fines at Their Worst?

It’s pretty clear from the graphs above: **weekday mornings** — especially between **8 AM and 10 AM** — are when fines are at their peak. Why? **Street cleaning!** This is the time when most of the parking violations happen, and it’s not surprising. We’re all busy in the morning, rushing to get to work, and sometimes we overlook those annoying street cleaning signs.

If you’re the type who likes to comute to work by car, **double-check the signs** before leaving your car. The fines come quick when street cleaning is in full swing!

### But What About Overnight?

If you’re hoping for a safer bet, here’s a little tip: **you’re a lot safer at night**. As the night settles in, fines drop significantly. This makes sense — fewer people are out and about, and street cleaning usually slows down after late hours. So, if you’re planning to park overnight, you're likely in the clear, especially if it's after **10 PM**.

### Weekdays vs. Weekends: Is There a Difference?

While fines definitely peak during the week, especially on **Thursday and Friday**, the weekend sees a noticeable dip.It is likely because fewer people are commuting and parking enforcement tends to relax a bit.

That being said, don’t let your guard down completely on weekends! In **tourist-heavy areas** like parts of Manhattan, parking violations can still add up, even on a Sunday. It’s all about knowing where you’re parking.

### What This Means for You

- **Street Cleaning? Avoid It**: If you’re parking in the morning, be extra cautious about street cleaning. If you see a sign, **don’t risk it**!
- **Go for Overnight Parking**: For a stress-free experience, use car to commute and park after dark. It’s safer, and you’ll avoid the early morning rush.
- **Know the Hotspots**: Some Borough, especially around downtown, have stricter rules. Stay informed about the areas you frequent visit to avoid fines.

So, next time you park, remember: timing matters. A little planning ahead can save you from that dreaded parking ticket!

- **Know the Neighborhoods with Moderate Fines**: Areas like **Greenwich Village** and **College Point** have moderate fines. Be mindful of regulations, but the chances of getting fined are lower.

Ever wondered if certain types of cars get fined more often than others? Well, it turns out, they do! The short answer is: yes. 🚗

It’s no surprise that sedans, SUVs, and vans top the list of most fined vehicles — probably because these are the cars you see everywhere. They're super common, which means they're more likely to end up in violation zones.

We also took a look at the most fined car makes. And guess what? Some violations are way more common for certain types of cars. So, if you're driving a Honda or a Toyota, you might just be in the line of fire for more parking tickets than others!
