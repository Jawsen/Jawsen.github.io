## 🕒 When Do People Get Fined?

Turns out, time really matters. Most tickets aren’t random — they spike around weekday mornings, especially during street cleaning hours. You’re a lot safer overnight.
Below, you can explore when fines peak during the day and how it varies.

### So, When Are Fines at Their Worst?

It’s pretty clear from the graphs above: **weekday mornings** — especially between **8 AM and 10 AM** — are when fines are at their peak. Why? **Street cleaning!** This is the time when most of the parking violations happen, and it’s not surprising. We’re all busy in the morning, rushing to get to work, and sometimes we overlook those annoying street cleaning signs.

If you’re the type who likes to comute to work by car, **double-check the signs** before leaving your car. The fines come quick when street cleaning is in full swing!

### But What About Overnight?

If you’re hoping for a safer bet, here’s a little tip: **you’re a lot safer at night**. As the night settles in, fines drop significantly. This makes sense — fewer people are out and about, and street cleaning usually slows down after late hours. So, if you’re planning to park overnight, you're likely in the clear, especially if it's after **10 PM**.

### Weekdays vs. Weekends: Is There a Difference?

While fines definitely peak during the week, especially on **Thursday and Friday**, the weekend sees a noticeable dip.It is likely because fewer people are commuting and parking enforcement tends to relax a bit.

That being said, don’t let your guard down completely on weekends! In **tourist-heavy areas** like parts of Manhattan, parking violations can still add up, even on a Sunday. It’s all about knowing where you’re parking.

### What This Means for You

- **Street Cleaning? Avoid It**: If you’re parking in the morning, be extra cautious about street cleaning. If you see a sign, **don’t risk it**!
- **Go for Overnight Parking**: For a stress-free experience, use car to commute and park after dark. It’s safer, and you’ll avoid the early morning rush.
- **Know the Hotspots**: Some Borough, especially around downtown, have stricter rules. Stay informed about the areas you frequent visit to avoid fines.

So, next time you park, remember: timing matters. A little planning ahead can save you from that dreaded parking ticket!

## 📍 Where Are the Hotspots?

Some neighborhoods are way more ticket-heavy than others — and it’s not just about how many people live there.
We adjusted for population to see which areas get the most fines per 1,000 residents. These are the hotspots you need to be aware of when you park in NYC. Scroll around the map to see how your neighborhood stacks up.

This shows how parking fines are spread across NYC — adjusted for population. Darker areas = more fines per 1,000 residents. Zoom around and hover to see which neighborhoods get fined the most.

- **Park Cautiously in High-Fine Areas**: If you’re in neighborhoods like **Douglaston-Little Neck** or **Flushing-Willets Point**, be extra cautious and check for street cleaning and other regulations.
- **Know the Neighborhoods with Moderate Fines**: Areas like **Greenwich Village** and **College Point** have moderate fines. Be mindful of regulations, but the chances of getting fined are lower.
- **Safer Parking Zones**: If you're looking for areas with fewer fines, **Canarsie** and **Lower East Side** might be more relaxed about parking violations.

## 🚘 Who’s Getting Fined?

Ever wondered if certain types of cars get fined more often than others? The short answer is: yes. 🚗

It’s no surprise that sedans, SUVs, and vans top the list of most fined vehicles — probably because these are the cars you see everywhere. They're super common, which means they're more likely to end up in violation zones.

We also took a look at the most fined car makes. And guess what? Some violations are way more common for certain types of cars. So, if you're driving a Honda or a Toyota, you might just be in the line of fire for more parking tickets than others!

Take a look at the full breakdown below to see which car types are racking up those fines.

## 🔮 Predicting Where Fines Are Most Likely

We trained a model to predict whether a neighborhood has a high fine rate or not, based on just two things: the total number of fines and population. The model was able to correctly classify neighborhoods about 87% of the time.

We also grouped neighborhoods into 3 clusters based on their population and fine rates. This helps us spot patterns — like which areas have lots of people but relatively fewer fines, and which ones get hit harder per person.

🟡 Big population, moderate fines

🔵 Smaller areas, fewer fines

🟢 High fine rates per person — the real hotspots

You can explore the map below to see which neighborhood falls into which group. Click around to see how NYC neighborhoods were grouped by fine patterns.

## 💡 Key Takeaways
So, what’s the big picture here?

🕒 Mornings are the most dangerous — especially if you’re parking during street cleaning hours. If you park early, be extra careful!

📍 Certain areas like Douglaston-Little Neck and Flushing-Willets Point are the hotspots for fines, while places like Canarsie and Lower East Side are a bit more relaxed.

🚗 SUVs are the main culprits when it comes to getting fined, followed by 4-door sedans and vans. Looks like the cars we see most often are the ones getting the most tickets.

🔮 Predictions work — if you know where the fines are most likely, you can avoid those areas. The map and data make it easy to spot high-risk zones.

💡 Want to avoid a ticket? Make sure to check for street cleaning signs, choose neighborhoods with fewer fines, and maybe skip parking in Manhattan during rush hour on Thursday mornings😅
