## Trend Over Time

\_Figure: **Calendar plot showing daily drug/narcotic incident frequency from 2009–2019 in San Francisco.**
The calendar visualizes a detailed year-by-year overview of drug/narcotic-related incidents in San Francisco from 2009 to 2019. Each row corresponds to a calendar year, with individual squares representing single days. The color intensity indicates the frequency of incidents on the day where darker green signifies a higher number of incidents.

What stands out immediately is the high density of dark green cells in 2009, especially concentrated in certain periods such as early spring and mid-summer. This suggests that drug-related crime was not only more prevalent but also more consistently reported throughout the calendar year.

As we move downward through the years, the green gradually fades. From around 2014 onward, the number of dark-colored cells drops significantly. By 2018–2019, the calendar is largely filled with pale or nearly white squares — a visual confirmation of the steady and substantial decline in drug/narcotic offenses over the decade.\_
