_A data-driven story exploring drug/narcotic-related crime patterns in San Francisco._

---

## Trend Over Time

![Calendar Heatmap of Drug/Narcotic Crime in SF](/assets/images/calendar_plot.png)

_Figure 1: Calendar plot showing daily drug/narcotic incident frequency from 2009–2019 in San Francisco._

The calendar visualizes a detailed year-by-year overview of drug/narcotic-related incidents. Each row represents a calendar year, and each square represents a single day. Color intensity (shades of green) reflects the frequency of incidents, where darker green indicates higher crime counts.

What stands out is the dense clustering of incidents in 2009, especially around early spring and summer. This suggests drug and narcotic related crime was not only more prevalent but also more consistent throughout the year.

From 2014 onward, the green fades significantly. By 2018–2019, the calendar is mostly pale — a visual confirmation of the steady decline in drug/narcotic offenses over the decade.

The geospatial heatmap visualizes the geographical distribution of drug/narcotic-related crimes in San Francisco. Areas with higher concentrations of incidents appear in warmer colors (yellow to green), while lower activity is shown in cooler tones (blue to purple). Because the map is citywide, specific hotspots may be difficult to distinguish at first glance but zooming in reveals clearer clusters of activity. Some of the most prominent hotspots emerge around the Tenderloin, Mission, Southern, and Bayview districts.

## Findings

The calendar visualization shows that drug and narcotic-related incidents peaked in 2009, with particularly dense clusters during the spring and summer months. Starting from 2014, there is a steady decrease in the number of incidents year by year. By 2018–2019, most days show low or no activity, as indicated by the pale colors on the calendar. The geospatial heatmap reveals that these incidents are concentrated in specific neighborhoods, especially in the Tenderloin, Mission, Southern, and Bayview districts.

## Conclusion

The data shows that drug-related crime was most widespread in 2009, especially during the spring and summer months. Since 2014, the number of incidents has steadily declined, with only a few cases observed in 2018–2019. This indicates a clear downward trend over time.

Geographically, most incidents occur in specific areas such as Tenderloin, Mission, Southern, and Bayview. This suggests that, although the overall crime level has decreased, it remains concentrated in certain neighborhoods.
